- This is a simple interactive number-matching game built with React.

- Click on buttons to find matching numbers. When two numbers match, they are marked in green. The goal is to match **all the numbers**!

How to Play :
1. Click on any button â€” it will be highlighted in green.
2. Now click on another button:
   - If it has the **same value** as the first, it will also be highlighted.
   - If not, nothing changes.
3. Continue matching all numbers one by one.
4. Once all buttons are green, the "Update" button turns into **"Restart Game"**.
5. You can click "Restart Game" to reshuffle and start again!
